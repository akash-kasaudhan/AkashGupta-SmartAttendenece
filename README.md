# AkashGupta-SmartAttendenece
The Smart Attendance Management System uses face recognition technology to automate attendance tracking. Developed by Akash Gupta, it captures facial images, trains a recognition model, and marks attendance automatically. The system sends notifications via email and SMS and includes a user-friendly Tkinter interface for easy operation

# **Smart Attendance Management System using Face Recognition 👦🏻👧**

**A Face Recognition-Based Attendance System**  
This system not only marks your attendance but also sends notifications via email & SMS. It includes a pre-defined instruction chatbot, and the user interface (UI) is built using **Tkinter**, a popular Python framework for desktop applications.

## **About the Project** ℹ️

This Smart Attendance System makes attendance management seamless with the power of **face recognition**. The system captures facial data, trains a model, and then recognizes faces to automatically fill in attendance, notifying users instantly. Whether you're a student or a professional, this system can modernize your attendance process.

## **Features** 🌟

- **Face Detection**: Automatically captures facial images and stores data.
- **Attendance Marking**: Fills attendance by recognizing your face.
- **Notification System**: Sends notifications via **Email & SMS**.
- **Chatbot Assistance**: Provides a helpful chatbot with predefined instructions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with **Tkinter** for an intuitive experience.

## **How it Works** 🛠️

1. **Add Your Face Data**:  
   Enter your **ID** and **Name** in the input box, then click on "Take Images." The system captures 100 images and stores them in the `data` folder.
  
2. **Train the Model**:  
   After data collection, click on "Train Image" to train the model. It takes approximately 1 minute to train (for 5 people).
  
3. **Detect Faces and Mark Attendance**:  
   Click "Face Detector" to begin face recognition and automatic attendance marking. A `.csv` file will be generated with attendance data, including time and name.

4. **Store Attendance in Database**:  
   Data can be stored in **MySQL Workbench**. Modify the database name as per your requirements.
